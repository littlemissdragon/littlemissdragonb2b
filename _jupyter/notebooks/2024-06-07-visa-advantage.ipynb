    "## Visa Types\n",
    "When it comes to traveling and *living abroad* in general, one of the major decisions one must make is related to the [visas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa) used to enter the desired country. Basically all visas can be grouped into *two basic* categories:\n",

    "Since the *long-term* visa will typically include *at least a year or more* of duration in the foreign country, we can begin to understand the advantage in terms of the additional months $\\Delta{N}$ acquired by residing/operating in the *foreign* country compared to the *country of origin*:\n",

    "*Figure 2* shows some interesting results. Naturally it makes sense that as the *visa duration* $N_{limit}$ increases from $1$ to $8$ years, the *additional months* $\\Delta{N}$ gained increases (because you are not *limited* by the *visa's duration* and can buy more time at a lower $C_f$ in the *foreign country*). But what is the nature of the strange *\"angle\"* or *\"kink\"* in each line?

    "Another *key insight* worth pointing out is that everything *below* the x-axis (i.e. when $\\Delta{N} \\lt 0$) is no longer *favorable*. Why? Because the `% wealth` $pW$ you set aside for *travel* $T$, *visa* $V$, *investment* $I$, and any other costs, leaves a *remaining wealth* $(1 - p)W$ that buys *less months* $N$ than if you stayed in your *home country* (in this case the *U.S.*).

So what we are seeing is, that as the *visa duration* increases, and you are legally allowed to reside in the *foreign country* for longer time, you can purchase *the same amount* of months for a *smaller percent* of your wealth.
