    "## Minimizing Cost of Living\n",
    "One of the *major* contributors to cost of living is **RENT**. Often rent can count for *more than double* the other cost of living [expenses](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=United+States). But in order to *eliminate* rent, a portion of wealth must be *invested* into purchasing property. This could *potentially* decrease the *number of months* $N$ that you can live at your current standard of living, given your wealth $W$. So what is the *optimal* portion of your wealth used to purchase property so as to *increase* $N$?"
