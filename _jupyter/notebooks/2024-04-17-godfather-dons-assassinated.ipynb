But what exactly is the *objective advantage* and possible *disadvantage* of this decision? What follows is a [*decision-theoretic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory) look at the *options* available to Michael Corleone and an attempt to prove what is the most **rational** decision."

So he has no *delusion* about what to expect from them ... he knows that he can never trust them, and that this *cold war* will continue if he does not take decisive action.
