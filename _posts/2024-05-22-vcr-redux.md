## Recap
In the [previous article](https://diogenesanalytics.com/blog/2024/05/20/value-cost-ratio) the `VCR` (*value/cost* ratio) was introduced as a way to determine when potential *investment scenarios* are favorable (i.e. you can actually *gain* more utility by winning than what it *costs to play*). The example *scenario* was the [lottery](https://diogenesanalytics.com/blog/2024/05/19/optimal-options), and it was suggested that a $\text{vcr} > 1$ *could be favorable*. The key word there is **could**. In fact what we saw in the [previous article](https://diogenesanalytics.com/blog/2024/05/20/value-cost-ratio) suggested that you actually need to know if the *net expected utility* $E(n)$ will be increasing *or* decreasing to really know if it is favorable to play (see below for $E(n)$ equation):

$$
E(n) = (1 - p^n)U - nC
$$

If $E(n)$ was increasing from $n = 1$ onward, then it was possible to increase your *net expected utility* by playing repeated trials of the game (e.g. in the *lottery* scenario this meant buying *more tickets*, as each ticket represented a repeated play of the game). If $E(n)$ decreased, then the *highest* possible *net expected utility* could only be achieved at $n = 1$.

## The Derivative
To state this more plainly, if the first derivative of $E(n)$ is positive, then it should ultimately be *favorable*:

$$
\frac{dE(n)}{dn} > 0
$$

Else if the first derivative of $E(n)$ is negative, it should **not** be favorable:

$$
\frac{dE(n)}{dn} < 0
$$

And the actual first derivative of the $E(n)$ equation:

$$
\frac{dE(n)}{dn} = -p^n \ln(p) U - C
$$

And substituting for the first derivative equation and rearranging we have a *favorable* outcome:

$$
\frac{-p^n \ln(p) U}{C} > 1
$$

And a *not favorable* outcome:

$$
\frac{-p^n \ln(p) U}{C} < 1
$$

## Retry
Now let us attempt to *retry* the previous *example investment data* from the [previous article](https://diogenesanalytics.com/blog/2024/05/19/optimal-options) and see what happens:

The two figures above show the results of using the *new VCR* equation based on $\frac{dE(n)}{dn}$ (shown below):

$$
\frac{-p^n \ln(p) U}{C}
$$

This *new VCR equation* works extremely well to indicate which *investments* are favorable, not just in terms of having a *positive net expected utility* but also having an *optimal options* value $n$. In truth one could simply just use the $\frac{dE(n)}{dn}$ equation evaluated at $n = 1$ to make the same judgement (this can be seen in the table below, where all values *E(n)*, *dE/dn*, and *vcr_redux* are evaluated at $n = 1$).

Notice how in the above table, everywhere that `dE/dn` $< 0$ the `vcr_redux` $< 1$? Again, you can simply use the $\frac{dE(n)}{dn}$ equation evaluated at $n = 1$ to get the same results as the *new VCR equation* (`vcr_redux`). Also notice that everywhere that $E(n)$ (evaluated at $n = 1$) is *negative* in the above table, the corresponding $\frac{dE(n)}{dn}$ is also negative.

## Moral
As it turns out, a little *calculus* can tell us *a lot* about what a *function* is doing. In this specific application, it allows us to determine when a specific set of *U*, *C*, and *p* values not only yield a *positive net expected utility* (i.e. $E(n) > 0$) but whether this particular *investment* has a maximum value somewhere in the range $n > 0$ (meaning that there is possibility for purchasing $n >=1$ *options* to increase $E(n)$.
