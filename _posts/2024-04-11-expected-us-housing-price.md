## The Average
As of Q2 2024, the [*average U.S. home value*](https://www.zillow.com/home-values/102001/united-states/)
according to *Zillow* is: $\textdollar354,179$. But what does this [*average*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean) really tell us? What insight about the *U.S. housing market* can we gain from this information? By itself, the average can really only give us a sense of the *central tendency* of the data: the vast majority of *U.S. housing prices* tend to cluster around this $\textdollar354,179$ price.

But what can it tell us about the *probability* that a house for sale in the U.S. market will have a given price (or fall within a certain *price range*)? Or that a given price *deviates significantly* from the average?

## Normal Distribution
As seen in figures 1 and 2 above, which use [*median U.S. housing price data from Wikipedia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_median_home_price), the average can really only give us a sense of the *central tendency* as mentioned before. To be able to answer questions related to *probabibility* we must create a [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution).

Figure 3 above shows the *normal distribution* of the 2024 *median U.S. housing prices* by state. It is generated by the following equation:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}
$$

Since the distribution is generated from the [*median*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) U.S. housing prices, the distribution is mising the *lower end* housing price values.

With this distribution, we can begin to *estimate* the probability of *seeing a given range of prices*. For example, what if we wanted to know the probability of seeing a house in the U.S. listed in the range $[\textdollar200,000 - \textdollar300,000]$? What we want to know is actually the *area* under the normal distribution.

As figure 4 indicates, you have a $20.45\%$ or a $\sim\frac{1}{5}$ *probability* of encountering a house priced in the range $[\textdollar200,000 - \textdollar300,000]$ within the U.S.

## Return of the Average
Now we are ready to actually begin to think about what the *average* means. As it turns out the average IS the value where, $50\%$ of the population is less than this value, and $50\%$ of the population is greater than this value.

Basically, half the time when searching housing prices in the U.S. you will encounter a price *below* the average (i.e. about $\textdollar354,179$), and half the time the price will be *above* the average. This can be useful as a *high-level* view of a distribution, but it cannot tell us what price can truly be *expected*.

## Expected Price
The truth about the [*expected*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) price is simply that it only makes sense to consider a *range of prices*. For example, does any **potential buyer** care about finding a house priced at *exactly* $\textdollar300,000$? What about $\textdollar300,100$ or $\textdollar299,900$? So again we must turn to the *normal distribution* to satisfy our query: what is the range of prices we can expect in the U.S. housing market?

What figure 5 shows, is that we can expect to see $68\%$ or $\sim\frac{2}{3}$ of the houses listed in the *U.S. housing market* will have a price in the range $[\textdollar200,000 - \textdollar500,000]$. This is the *lion's share* of the market, with the remaining $32\%$ or $\sim\frac{1}{3}$ of the market containing houses listed with price below $\textdollar200,000$ or above $\textdollar500,000$.

## Moral
The *average* (i.e. $\textdollar354,179$) is not a good representation of the *expected* value that a **potential buyer** will encounter. Instead, a better representation of what to expect is the $68\%$ or $\sim\frac{2}{3}$ probability that a house listed in the *U.S. housing market* will have a price in the range $[\textdollar200,000 - \textdollar500,000]$. The average is best understood as a *condensed* estimate of where values *cluster* (i.e. around $\textdollar354,179$). It is a *high-level* view of the population, but without the *standard deviation* it cannot be used to reason about the values that will be obtained [*empirically*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_research).
